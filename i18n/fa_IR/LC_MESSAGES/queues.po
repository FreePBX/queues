"When set to 'Yes' agents who are on an occupied phone will be skipped as if "
"the line were returning busy. This means that Call Waiting or multi-line "
"phones will not be presented with the call and in the various hunt style "
"ring strategies, the next agent will be attempted. <br />When set to 'Yes + "
"(ringinuse=no)' the queue configuration flag 'ringinuse=no' is set for this "
"queue in addition to the phone's device status being monitored. This results "
"in the queue tracking remote agents (agents who are a remote PSTN phone, "
"called through Follow-Me, and other means) as well as PBX connected agents, "
"so the queue will not attempt to send another call if they are already on a "
"call from any queue. <br />When set to 'Queue calls only (ringinuse=no)' the "
"queue configuration flag 'ringinuse=no' is set for this queue also but the "
"device status of locally connected agents is not monitored. The behavior is "
"to limit an agent belonging to one or more queues to a single queue call. If "
"they are occupied from other calls, such as outbound calls they initiated, "
"the queue will consider them available and ring them since the device state "
"is not monitored with this option. <br /><br />WARNING: When using the "
"settings that set the 'ringinuse=no' flag, there is a NEGATIVE side effect. "
"An agent who transfers a queue call will remain unavailable by any queue "
"until that call is terminated as the call still appears as 'inuse' to the "
"queue UNLESS 'Agent Restrictions' is set  to 'Extensions Only'."
