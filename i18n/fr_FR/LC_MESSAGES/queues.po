The behavior is to limit an agent belonging to one or more queues to a single queue call. If they are occupied from other calls, such as outbound calls they initiated, the queue will consider them available and ring them since the device state is not monitored with this option. <br /><br />WARNING: When using the settings that set the 'ringinuse=no' flag, there is a NEGATIVE side effect.
